# 30thStreet

[Demo](https://juliuso.com/projects/30thStreet/)

30thStreet pays tribute to the Solari Flipboard that was removed from Philadelphia's AMTRAK 30th Street Station in early 2019. Initial goals are to replicate the flipboard's behavior with train schedule data obtained from public images and video recordings of the flipboard in action.

## Immediate Goals

* Find a suitable animation to mimic the flip-down effect.
* Find a suitable sound effect to complement each flip transition.
* Get the sound effect to play and behave consistenly across browsers.
